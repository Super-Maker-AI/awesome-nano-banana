### Case 55: AI Cat Image Generator (by @Supermaker AI)

🐱 **Pet Photography & Virtual Pet Adoption**

[[**Try it Now**](https://supermaker.ai/image/ai-cat-image-generator/)]

**Prompt**
```yaml
Based on user-uploaded photos of a scene, a hyper-realistic, lifelike cat is generated, allowing it to blend naturally into the existing environment and meet the user's "Cloud Cat Adoption" needs.

Cats must meet the following criteria:

Realistic Details: Rendering naturally soft fur textures (including subtle color variations and lighting), clear facial features (bright, expressive eyes, delicate whiskers, and realistic noses/mouths), and smooth, natural body contours (no cartoonish or stiff elements).

Seamless Flow: Ensure the cat appears to exist naturally in the scene by adding subtle shadows underneath the cat (aligning with the scene's lighting direction) and avoiding any obvious "cut-and-paste" edges. If the scene contains textures (e.g., fabric, wood, grass), the cat's contact with these surfaces should appear realistic (e.g., fur gently clinging to a soft sofa).

The end result should make users feel like they are seeing a real cat in the uploaded scene

### Case 54: Raincoat Effect (by @Supermaker AI)

🌧️ **Weather Effects & Atmospheric Photography**

[[**Try it Now**](https://supermaker.ai/image/raincoat-effect/)]

**Prompt**
```yaml
Transform the uploaded single-person photo into a realistic close-up portrait with the following key elements:
The person must be wearing a well-fitted black raincoat (with visible texture details like fabric wrinkles, possible slight water absorption effects, and natural collar/hem shapes).
The scene must depict a heavy downpour—show distinct, dense rain streaks falling around the person, splashes of rain on the ground (if lower body is visible), and subtle water droplets on the raincoat surface, hair, or shoulders to enhance authenticity.
Maintain the original person's core facial features, posture, and basic appearance (avoid altering key identifiers like facial structure, hairstyle length/color, or obvious accessories) while integrating them naturally into the rainy environment.
Adjust the lighting to match a heavy rain scenario: soft, diffused ambient light (simulate overcast weather), possible subtle highlights on wet surfaces (e.g., raincoat fabric, skin), and avoid harsh shadows.
Ensure the close-up framing focuses on the upper body (at least from shoulders up, or extending to mid-torso if appropriate) to highlight the raincoat details and the interaction between the person and the rain.
Keep the overall tone realistic and immersive—avoid overly stylized or cartoonish effects; prioritize natural rain dynamics and realistic material textures of the raincoat.

### Case 45: AI Black And White Portrait Generator (by @Supermaker AI)

📸 **Black & White Portrait & Fine Art Photography**

**Prompt**
```yaml
Uploaded photos are transformed into high-resolution black-and-white portrait artworks in a documentary-style, fine-art photography style. The background features a soft gradient, transitioning from mid-gray to near-white, creating a sense of depth and a sense of silence. The subtle film grain lends the image a tactile, analog-like softness, reminiscent of classic black-and-white photography.
The subject's blurred yet striking face emerges from the shadows, not in a traditional pose, but rather as if captured in a moment of reflection or breath. His face, contoured by light, evokes a sense of mystery, intimacy, and elegance. His features are refined and profound, radiating a melancholic and poetic beauty without seeming artificial.
A gentle, directional light, softly diffused, caresses the curve of his cheek or creates a glint in his eye—this is the emotional core of the image. The rest, occupied by ample negative space, is deliberately kept simple, allowing the image to breathe freely. There are no words or logos in the image—only a play of light and shadow, interwoven with emotion. The overall atmosphere is abstract yet deeply human, like a fleeting glance or a memory half-awake: intimate, timeless, and wistfully beautiful.
